                    Project Idea:
                    The PMS (Product Management System) project is a simple product management system built using PHP and JSON. Its main goal is to manage a small online store. The system allows users (such as customers) to browse products, add them to a cart, update quantities, remove products from the cart, and finally complete the purchase through a "Checkout" process. This project is ideal for beginners in web development because it uses simple technologies like PHP and JSON instead of complex databases like MySQL.

                    <p>
                    
The PMS project is a basic e-commerce website that includes several pages, such as:

Home Page (index.php): Displays available products (e.g., Pro-max, Camera, Smart Watch, etc.) with their prices and ratings, allowing users to add products to their cart.
Cart Page (cart.php): Shows the products the user has added to the cart, with options to update quantities or remove products.
Checkout Page (checkout.php): Allows the user to complete the purchase by entering their details (e.g., address and phone number).
Additional Pages: Such as the login page (login.php), registration page (register.php), and contact page (contact.php).
The project uses JSON files (e.g., product.json, cart.json, checkout.json) instead of a database to store data about products, the cart, and orders. It also uses PHP's $_SESSION to manage the cart during a user's session.
